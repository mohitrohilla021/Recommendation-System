# Recommendation-System


Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In this notebook, we will explore recommendation systems based on Collaborative Filtering and implement simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library.

__Collaborative Filtering__

This technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the __Pearson Correlation Function__.
