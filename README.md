# Recommendation-System-Collaborative-Filteringâœ”

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous and can be commonly seen in online stores, movie databases and job finders. In this notebook, we will explore recommendation systems based on Collaborative Filtering and implement a simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library.
 
__Collaborative Filtering__, which is also known as __User-User Filtering__. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the __Pearson Correlation Function__.
 
A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications.

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. 

Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services
